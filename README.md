Clean MVVM Boilerplate with no  thirdparty lib.

Hi,

Previously, I Had posted a boilerplate project for android using kotlin which has all Third-party libs with MVVM architecture.  We need these type of boilerplates to start a quick enterprise-level project but, sometimes we don't want to use any third-party library but still want to use architecture like MVVM.

So, I am sharing my MVVM Architecture Boilerplate project(Written in Java) which uses no third-party lib.

It can help you to understand how to use async task with MVVM, Android collection's LruCache etc..
