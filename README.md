Clean MVVM Boilerplate with no thirdparty lib.

Previously, I Had posted a boilerplate project for android using kotlin
which has all Third-party libs with MVVM architecture. We need these
type of boilerplates to start a quick enterprise-level project but,
sometimes we don't want to use any third-party library but still want to
use architecture like MVVM.

So, I am sharing my MVVM Architecture Boilerplate project(Written in
Java) which uses no third-party lib.

It can help you to understand how to use async task with MVVM, Android
collection's LruCache etc..
